# Grade Calculator

This project is part of my journey in learning C++. It is a simple grade calculator that allows users to calculate their grades either by GPA or by percentage.

## Files

- `grades.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the grade calculation functions.
- `grades.h`: Header file declaring the grade calculation functions.
- `main.cpp`: Main file containing the menu and user interaction logic.

## Functionality

### Main Menu
Upon running the program, users are presented with a main menu with the following options:
1. Calculate your grade
2. Close

### Grade Calculator Menu
If the user selects "Calculate your grade", they are presented with a submenu with the following options:
1. Calculate your mark by GPA
2. Calculate your mark by percentage
3. Close

### GPA Calculator
The GPA calculator prompts the user to enter the number of subjects and the range of marks (e.g., 10, 20, 100). It then calculates the GPA based on the entered marks.

### Percentage Calculator
The percentage calculator also prompts the user for the number of subjects and the range of marks. It then calculates the percentage based on the entered marks.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Dragonkuro2/CPP-projects.git
   cd CPP-projects/Easy/Grade_calculator
